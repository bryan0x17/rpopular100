# Rpopular 100


## Description:

Rpopular100 is a lightweight Reddit client that only shows the top 100 posts from r/popular. There's no authentication, upvoting or downvoting, and opening the post or the comments redirects to Reddit.

This is a project I made as part of the Codecademy fullstack course. The goal was to become familiar with and build an app using React and Redux. I simplified some of the requirements, because a lightweight and fast reddit client is something that I personally would also use.

## Technologies:

This app was made using create-react-app with the react-redux template. 

## Future features:

- Blacklist/blocklist for posts from certain subreddits
- Fix posts that only have a link to an article - right now these posts show nothing
- Implement infinite scrolling

## Deployment

The app can be run on your local machine using npm, or you can run it on replit below.
